Me and Prince analyzed United States federal elections history for the House and President going back 50 years or so, looking at how each state voted along party lines. It’s seeing the American people through the lens of state and party that can be very concerning. There is much literature about how there are very few party loyalists as a percentage of the population, and the reason elections seem very close is that many voters simply choose a candidate without regard for party, and by chance alone there are ties and narrow victories. Something similar might be said of red and blue states. The people living there are not all Republicans or all Democrats; many in fact are just people who care little for politics. Even where there is heavy political engagement, such as on college campuses, people care more about particular issues and should not so easily be dismissed as staunch Democrats or Republicans. Polarization in the United States gives the harmful message that everyone is or should be at one another’s throats, when really that is a gross simplification and should not be accepted at face value.
