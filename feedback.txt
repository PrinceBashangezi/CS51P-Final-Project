This was the longest I spent on any assignment this semester. Me and Prince spent roughly 10 hours on this project, getting bogged down by miscellaneous issues such having to clean the massive datasets and exploring different ways to plot our graphs. It still proved to be an enjoyable experience - there’s always an air of accomplishment when we figured out different solutions - and it’s great to do it with a friend.
